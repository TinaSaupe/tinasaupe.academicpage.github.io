 I conducted my PhD studies at the <a href="https://genomics.ut.ee/en">Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu</a> ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª and defended my dissertation titled [_**The genetic history of the Mediterranean before the common era: a focus on the Italian Peninsula**_](https://dspace.ut.ee/items/3a371275-20d4-4c16-bf11-84c9bd50a6ee) in August 2022. My research has mainly focused on the demographic history of the Mediterrean Basin during the Bronze Age period, however, I finally have decided to move on and will focus on Finnish population studies now.
